# Check list 

Make sure these points are fixed before release of v2.0.0 of NetDynFlow.

6. Variabla `sigma_sqrt`not used !! I must have done something wrong.
7. Finalise the Jupyter Notebooks in Examples folder. Split into two notebooks? 



### Finished

1. Choose one version for the core module between *core1.py* and *core2.py*.
2. Clean imports from `__init__.py` file.
3. Correctly cite the published papers everywhere ( README.md, `__init__.py`, etc. )
4. Simplify internal variable naming. Homogenize internal naming with pyMOU package.
5. Add a folder with tutorial Jupyter Notebooks.
