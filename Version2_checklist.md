# Check list 

Make sure these points are fixed before release of v2.0.0 of NetDynFlow.


1. In Notebooks, change the NetDynFlow installation path.
7. Finalise the Jupyter Notebooks in Examples folder. Split into two notebooks? 



### Finished

1. Choose one version for the core module between *core1.py* and *core2.py*.
2. Clean imports from `__init__.py` file.
3. Correctly cite the published papers everywhere ( README.md, `__init__.py`, etc. )
4. Simplify internal variable naming. Homogenize internal naming with pyMOU package.
5. Add a folder with tutorial Jupyter Notebooks.
6. Variable `sigma_sqrt`not used !! I must have done something wrong.
