def TTPdistance(tensor, timestep):
    """Returns the time at which links reach peak communicability.

    Write more here ...  TTP is the time the response on node j take to reach
    peak, after a perturbation at node i.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : ndarray of rank-3
        Temporal evolution of the network's dynamic communicability. A tensor
        of shape n_nodes x n_nodes x timesteps , where n_nodes is the number of nodes.
    timestep : real valued number.
        Sampling time-step. This has to be the time-step employed to simulate
        the temporal evolution encoded in 'tensor'.

    Returns
    -------
    ttp_matrix : ndarray of rank-2
        An N x N matrix (n = number of nodes) contaning the time-to-peaks for
        all pairs of nodes. TTP is the time the response on node j take to reach
        peak, after a perturbation at node i.
        Analogous to the graph distance matrix in binary graphs.
    average_ttp : real valued.
        The average time-to-peak distance in the network.
        Analogous to the average pathlength of graphs.
