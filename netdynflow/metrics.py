    The time pair-wise interaction, nodes or networks need to decay back to zero.

    Strictly speaking, this function measures the time that the cumulative

    For example, 'fraction = 0.99' means the time needed to reach 99%

    The total accumulated flow of pair-wise, nodes or network flow over time.

    the whole network, depending on the input array given.
    - If 'arr' is the (N x N x nt) flow tensor, the output 'totalflow' will be
