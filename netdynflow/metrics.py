def TimeToPeak(arr, timestep):
    """
    The time links, nodes or networks need to reach peak flow.

    In terms of binary graphs, time-to-peak is equivalen to the pathlength
    between two nodes.

    The function calculates the time-to-peak for either links, nodes or the
    whole network, depending on the input array given.
    - If 'arr' is the (N x N x nt) tensor flow, the output 'ttp_arr' will be
    an N x N matrix with the ttp between every pair of nodes.
    - If 'arr' is the (N x nt) temporal flow of the N nodes, the output
    'ttp_arr' will be an array of length N, containing the ttp of the N nodes.
    - If 'arr' is the array of length nt for the network flow, then 'ttp_arr'
    will be a scalar, indicating the time at which whole-network flow peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray of adaptive shape, according to the case.
        Temporal evolution of the flow. An array of shape N X N X nt for the
        flow of the links, an array of shape N X nt for the flow of the nodes,
        or a 1-dimensional array of length nt for the network flow.
    timestep : real valued number.
        Sampling time-step. This has to be the time-step employed to simulate
        the temporal evolution encoded in 'arr'.

    Returns
    -------
    ttp_arr : ndarray of rank-2
        The time(s) taken for links, nodes or the network to reach peak flow.
        Output shape depends on input.
