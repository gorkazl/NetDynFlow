Analysis of dynamic communicability and flow
============================================

Functions to analyse the dynamic communicability or flow "tensors", which have
been previously calculated from a given network.

Metrics derived from the tensors
--------------------------------
TotalEvolution
    Calculates total communicability or flow over time for a network.
NodeEvolution
    Temporal evolution of all nodes' input and output communicability or flow.
Diversity
    Temporal diversity for a networks dynamic communicability or flow.
