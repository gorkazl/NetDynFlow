Miscelaneous tools and helpers
==============================
Several extra functions to help in the analysis of networks using the dynamic
communicability or flow
Randomization of (weighted) networks
-------------------------------------
RewireLinkWeights
    Randomly re-allocates the link weights of an input network.
RandomiseWeightedNetwork:
    Randomises a (weighted) connectivity matrix.
!!!!!!!!!!!!
GORKA: Shall we may name this module as 'benchmarks' or 'nullmodels'?
!!!!!!!!!!!!
GORKA: I am thinking to import pyGAlib for some utilities and network generation
functions. On the one hand, I don't want to enforce NetDynFlow users to use
pyGAlib, just because it is my library. But on the other hand, I don't think
that copy/pasting functions from pyGAlib into this module is robust. Replicating
functions may lead to bugs. Better to have only one function to do a job and,
if that one is broken, it only needs to be fixed once.
What shall we do?

    # GORKA: This version seems to be faster, with and without Numba.

    """
    Randomises a (weighted) connectivity matrix.
    The function returns a random connectivity matrix with the same number of
    links as the input matrix. The resulting connectivity has the same link
    weights of the input matrix (thus total weight is also conserved) but the
    input / output strengths of the nodes are not conserved. If 'con' is an
    unweighted adjacency matrix, the function returns an Erdos-Renyi-like
    random graph, of same size and number of links as 'con'.
    If the binarisation of 'con' is a symmetric matrix, the result will also be
    symmetric. Otherwise, if 'con' represents a directed network, the result
    will be directed.
    !!!!!!!
    GORKA: In the current version, if the underlying graph is undirected but the
    weights are asymmetric, the function won't work. The result will be a
    symmetric matrix and the total weight will likely not be conserved !!!
