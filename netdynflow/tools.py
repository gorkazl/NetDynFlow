Miscelaneous tools and helpers
==============================
Several extra functions to help in the analysis of networks using the dynamic
communicability or flow
Randomization of (weighted) networks
-------------------------------------
RewireLinkWeights
    Randomly re-allocates the link weights of an input network.
RandomiseWeightedNetwork:
    Randomises a (weighted) connectivity matrix.
!!!!!!!!!!!!
GORKA: Shall we may name this module as 'benchmarks' or 'nullmodels'?
!!!!!!!!!!!!
GORKA: I am thinking to import pyGAlib for some utilities and network generation
functions. On the one hand, I don't want to enforce NetDynFlow users to use
pyGAlib, just because it is my library. But on the other hand, I don't think
that copy/pasting functions from pyGAlib into this module is robust. Replicating
functions may lead to bugs. Better to have only one function to do a job and,
if that one is broken, it only needs to be fixed once.
What shall we do?
