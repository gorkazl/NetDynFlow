Network and surrogate generation module
=======================================

Functions to construct synthetic networks and generate surrogates out of given
binary or weighted networks.

Generation and randomization of binary graphs
---------------------------------------------
These functions are all imported from the GAlib library. Please see doctsring
of module 'galib.models' for further documentation and a list of functions.  ::

    Randomly re-allocates the link weights of an input network.

    The function does not alter the position of the links, it only shuffles
    the weights associated to the links. Therefore, the binarised version
    is preserved.

    Parameters
    ----------
    con : ndarray
        Adjacency matrix of the (weighted) network.

    Returns
    -------
    rewmatrix : ndarray
        A connectivity matrix with links between same nodes as 'con' but the
        link weights shuffled.

def RandomiseWeightedNetwork(con):
    """
    Randomises a connectivity matrix and its weights.

    Returns a random connectivity matrix with the same number of links and
    same link weights as the input matrix 'con'. Therefore, both the total
    weight and the link weight distribution are conserved but the input/output
    degrees and node strengths are not.

    The function identifies some properties of 'con' in order to conserve
    elementary properties of 'con'. For example:
    1) The resulting random weighted network will only contain self-connections
    (non-zero diagonal entries) if 'con' contains self-connections.
    2) If 'con' is an unweighted adjacency matrix (directed or undirected), the
    result is an Erdos-Renyi-type random graph (directed or undirected),
    of same size and number of links as 'con'.
    3) If 'con' is an undirected network but contains asymmetric link weights,
    the result will be an undirected random graph with asymmetric weights.
    4) If 'con is a directed weighted network, the result will be a directed and
    weighted network. In this case, weights cannot be symmetric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    con : ndarray
        Adjacency matrix of the (weighted) network.

    Returns
